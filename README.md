# music-genre-classification

During my Master's program, a colleague and I performed a decision tree classification analysis on song attributes. We used Spotify data obtained from the Spotify API. The data has various attributes for each song such as tempo and popularity. 

## TLDR
The best decision tree model reported a 61% precision, 61% recall, and 64% accuracy across all genres. The model could accurately identify Classical and Opera songs the best and R&B and Soul songs the worst. 

#### Note:
I was proud of what I accomplished with this project but I would like to reproduce this analysis one day. Upon review, there are several things I would do differently in this analysis such as change the process of the data engineering for the project. Overall, this was a fun project to complete and review the results of this classification.
